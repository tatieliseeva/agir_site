<h2> Who we are </h2>

<h2> Our Mission </h2>

AGiR! is here to provide information and promote research!

A big picture concept for the public interest:
genomic integrity is meant to include all the molecular genetic details in our cells. Our cells have 25000 genes and more, including all sorts of RNAs, many levels of epigenetics, expression induction and repression depending on environmental cues; and probably 5000 genes are essential for basic life processes. The 'genomic integrity' concept is meant to simplify the complex and dynamic activities in all our cells into something we can all attempt to grasp. Anything that blocks or disrupts these dynamic processes can potentially disturb health and well-being…

In a sense we already have known of 'the cause' of cancer (and of so many other ailments) for such a long time:
Genetic lesions, the disruption of proper gene expression, breaks in and losses of chromosomal regions, and so on, impact on 'genomic integrity' in so many possible ways, given those 20k+ genes we have in our cells, result in chronic diseases...

You can act to protect Genomic integrity in many ways - even less sugar intake is one way to reduce 'reactive oxygen species' levels, for instance….   
The choices made are key!

The aim of the international association, AGiR! Action for Genomic integrity through Research!, is to provide information about how so many common practices can result in DNA damage (also indirectly, via our own cellular processes) or can affect gene expression (via e.g. RNAs or epigenetic 'marks' on DNA itself or associated histone proteins).

AGiR! wants to promote research, to determine how to not only quantify impacts on genomic integrity, but perhaps prevent them!
