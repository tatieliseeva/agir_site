Genomic integrity in the organism's cell is the active maintenance for proper dynamic function of all the genetic elements, including DNA, RNAs, epigenetic factors & proper developmental gene expression. We also call it health.

Genomic Integrity is not easily seen, but it can be readily disrupted by a variety of agents. It is threatened by many common substances, such as X-Rays, alcohol, sunshine, grilled food, and even some ingredients in personal care products.

While DNA repair is key, fixing new mutations in the genome after damage can be very error-prone. More awareness of these issues and research should help promote prevention, which is always better than a cure.

AGiR aims to promote research into reliable and quantitative measures of genomic integrity and to create greater awareness of the ways one can easily protect genomic integrity.
