Genomic integrity in the organism's cell is the active maintenance for proper dynamic function of all the genetic elements, including DNA, RNAs, epigenetic factors & proper developmental gene expression. We also call it health.

Genomic integrity is threatened by many common substances, including ingredients in personal care products.  
(if you can't see the intro, above, or would like to see better resolution slides, please go directly to the Slideshare presentation!)

For further background information about DNA damage and its repair, you may find this Prezi of interest! (to check out when you are not on your phone, please, however...)
AGiR aims to promote research into reliable and quantitative measures of genomic integrity and to create greater awareness of the ways one can easily protect genomic integrity.  
Genomic Integrity is not easily seen, but it can be readily disrupted by a variety of agents.  While DNA repair is key, after damage this process can be very error-prone, fixing new mutations in the genome!  More awareness of these issues and research should help promote prevention, which is always better than a cure!  Join us!
