<h2>Moving forward, virtually and really!</h2>

The general assembly meeting went well last week, with 9 different computers on the zoom connection, including two from outside the country (one with two founding members, who were 'attending' their first such meeting!), and unanimous votes to help us move forward as an association to make more international impact.  
Probably we will not only try to become an association of 'public utility' this year, but organise a bigger and better chocolate sale!  =) 
In addition, plans for more work to open-source the DNA damage assays and develop the 'cheek cell chip' for both micronuclei and comets and more

Thank you to all the participants (and also to those who took the time to excuse themselves for not being able to come!)!
